## Short Story Assignment - AutoVAS: An automated vulnerability analysis system with a deep-learning approach
Summary - Software vulnerabilities are growing quickly, but methods to understand and address them rely on manual analyses, which slow down response time. Deep learning algorithms have been used in automated vulnerability searches based on source code to conduct studies on the prediction of vulnerabilities or the detection of patterns of prior vulnerabilities. Existing techniques, however, either focus on a small number of security flaws or utilize source code sparingly when compiling data. Methods that represent source code as an embedding vector have not received much research. In order to effectively represent source code as embedding vectors by using various datasets, this study proposes an automated vulnerability analysis system (AutoVAS) based on deep learning.
